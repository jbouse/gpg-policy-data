Usage Policies for OpenPGP Keys						v1.0

	As keys collect signatures in the course of their lifetime I will 
only publish the fingerprints within this document as the keys and signatures
should always be available on the public key servers.

My Old general purpose key:

pub  1024D/3DC9F946 1999-11-30 Jeremy T. Bouse <jbouse -at- debian.org>
     Key fingerprint = 1319 D7E5 12DE 640C 1B14  39A9 21C2 5754 3DC9 F946
uid                            Jeremy T. Bouse (JB5713) <undrgrid -at- undergrid.net>

	This policy document does not apply to this key as the use of this
general purpose key has been retired in favor of the new keys below.


My Debian primary key:

pub  1024D/29AB4CDD 2002-03-27 Jeremy T. Bouse (Debian Maintainer Key) <jbouse -at- debian.org>
     Key fingerprint = C745 FA35 27B4 32A6 91B3  3935 D573 D5B1 29AB 4CDD
     

My Personal primary key:

pub  1024D/62DBDF62 2002-03-27 Jeremy T. Bouse <Jeremy.Bouse -at- UnderGrid.net>
     Key fingerprint = E636 AB22 DC87 CD52 A3A4  D809 544C 4868 62DB DF62


My Work primary key:

pub  1024D/6D2112AA 2002-04-11 Jeremy T. Bouse (NTT Multimedia Communications Laboratories, Inc.) <jeremy -at- nttmcl.com>
     Key fingerprint = 2A06 920A 30F6 02EF AD1B  89B0 5499 EB87 6D21 12AA


	Primary keys are stored offline on an encrypted removable 
media with multi-word pass phrases making use of mixed alphanumerics. This
removable media is stored in a fire safe along with a CDROM containing the
revocation certificates for all keys and a hardcopy print-out of each 
recovation certificate. This key is only removed from storage when needed
to sign a key or management of subkeys.

	Subkeys for each of the primary keys are stored on an encrypted USB
flash drive with multi-word pass phrases making use of mixed alphanumerics
and kept on my person at all times. These keys are not stored on any machine
and accessed only from the encrypted USB flash drive. Subkeys shall have a
lifetime of no more than 30 months enforced via an expiration date at which
time a new subkey shall be generated using the primary key.

	Signatures made by these keys later than the posted date of this
policy document are only considered valid if they contain a policy URL of
the form:
	http://undergrid.net/~undrgrid/legal/gpg/<name>.<date>?md5sum=<md5>
	<name> is the name of the policy
	<date> is the date the policy was issued
	<md5> is the md5 has of the policy document

	A valid policy document will have clearsigned signature files by
all the primary keys at a URL of the form:
	http://undergrid.net/~undrgrid/legal/gpg/<name>.<date>.<key>.sign
	<name> is the name of the policy
	<date> is the date the policy was issued
	<key> is the Key ID of the primary key
