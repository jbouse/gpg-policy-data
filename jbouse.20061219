Usage Policies for OpenPGP Keys						v1.1

	As keys collect signatures in the course of their lifetime I will 
only publish the fingerprints within this document as the keys and signatures
should always be available on the public key servers.

My Old retired pre-policy key:

pub   1024D/3DC9F946 1999-11-30 [revoked: 2006-04-04]
      Key fingerprint = 1319 D7E5 12DE 640C 1B14  39A9 21C2 5754 3DC9 F946

general purpose key has been retired in favor of the new keys below.

certificates submitted to the keyservers. If you have these keys in your 
keyring please refresh them.

My Work primary key:

	Primary keys are stored offline on an encrypted removable storage
media with multi-word pass phrases making use of mixed alphanumerics. This
removable media is stored in a fire safe along with a CD-ROM containing the
revocation certificates for all keys and a hard copy print-out of each 
revocation certificate. This key is only removed from storage when needed
to sign a key or management of subkeys.

	Subkeys for each of the primary keys are stored on an encrypted USB
flash drive with multi-word pass phrases making use of mixed alphanumerics
and kept on my person at all times. These keys are not stored on any machine
and accessed only from the encrypted USB flash drive. Subkeys shall have a
lifetime of no more than 30 months enforced via an expiration date at which
time a new subkey shall be generated using the primary key.

	Signatures made by these keys later than the posted date of this
policy document are only considered valid if they contain a policy URL of
the form:
	http://undergrid.net/legal/gpg/<name>.<date>?md5sum=<md5>
	<name> is the name of the policy
	<date> is the date the policy was issued
	<md5> is the md5 has of the policy document

	A valid policy document will have clear-signed signature files by
all current primary keys at a URL of the form:
	http://undergrid.net/legal/gpg/<name>.<date>.<key>.sign
	<name> is the name of the policy
	<date> is the date the policy was issued
	<key> is the Key ID of the primary key
