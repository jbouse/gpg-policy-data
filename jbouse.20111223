Jeremy T. Bouse OpenPGP Key Transition Announcement

Issued: December 23, 2011


I am going to replace my current DSA OpenPGP keys with new RSA OpenPGP keys.

The current DSA keys are not to be considered compromised. They will remain my
official keys for regular communications until the new ones are well connected
(more than 20 certifications and MSD < 4.3). When this condition is met, the
new RSA keys become my offical keys and a 3-month expiration period is set for
the DSA keys.

The keys are cross-certified and this document is signed by both the current
and new keys.

The new keys are available on public keyservers. My preferred keyserver is
pool.sks-keyservers.net. If you use the 'no-honor-keyserver-url' GnuPG option
(or equivalent option in other OpenPGP software), please make sure to use an
up-to-date keyserver. Many keyservers are still using very old and buggy
releases of PKS software and do not correctly handle keys with multiple subkeys.
The keyservers that can handle multiple subkeys are summarized on
sks-keyservers.net. Consider setting pool.sks-keyservers.net as your default
keyserver and add the 'repair-pks-subkey-bug' option to your GnuPG configuration.
